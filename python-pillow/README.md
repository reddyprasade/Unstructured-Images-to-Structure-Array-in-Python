## Python Pillow Library
Pillow is a preferred image manipulation tool. Python version 2 used Python Image Library (PIL), and Python version 3 uses Pillow Python Library, an upgrade of PIL.
You should first create a virtual environment in Anaconda for different projects. Make sure you have supporting packages like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to install in the virtual environment you create.

Once you set up the packages, you can easily install Pillow using pip [Pytohn-Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/).
***
```bash
pip install Pillow
```
***
You can confirm that the library is installed correctly by checking its version.
```
# check Pillow version number
import PIL
print('Pillow Version:', PIL.__version__)
```
