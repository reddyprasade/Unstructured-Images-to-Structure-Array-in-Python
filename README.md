# Unstructured-Images-to-Structure-Array-in-Python
Machine learning, Python uses image data in the form of a NumPy array, i.e., [Height, Width, Channel] format. To enhance the performance of the predictive model, we must know how to load and manipulate images. In Python, we can perform one task in different ways. We have options from Numpy to Pytorch and CUDA, depending on the complexity of the problem.  By the end of this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience with:  Loading and displaying an image using Matplotlib, OpenCV and Keras API Converting the loaded images to the NumPy array and back Conducting basic manipulation of an image using the Pillow and NumPy libraries and saving it to your local system. Reading images as arrays in Keras API and OpenCV
