# Matplotlib library

<img src ='https://matplotlib.org/_static/logo2_compressed.svg'/>
We will use the Matplotlib library to load the same image and display it in the Matplotlib frame. Just like PIL, it has the `image` class that performs the same function. 
Functions used in this piece of code are `imread()`, which loads the image in the form of an array of the pixel and `imshow()`, which displays that image.

We will use the **pyplot** class from the Matplotlib library to plot the image into the frame.

***
## Install 
```
pip install matpoltilib

```
## Import Matplotlib

```
# load and display an image with Matplotlib
from matplotlib import image
from matplotlib import pyplot
```
